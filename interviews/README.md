What does a typical interview look like and what does in aim to discover in the 
candidate?

I have been giving interviews since a long time, probably longer
than I can remember. Let me pen down the evolution of interviews

1. Internship

* Different companies had diffeent styles of interviewing. Some like Barclays Bank
had a Group discussion round on prioritizing task list. 
The idea was pretty simple. 
Given a task list comprising on 
  * Call a vendor
  * Call a colleague
  * settle an issue etc
what order would you execute them, and slot them in your daily schedule. 
The tasks were vague and their interpretation was open to interpretation. 

* Puzzles - Please read "How to move Mount Fuji" for the most epic collection
of puzzles ever. 

* CourseWork related questions: Whether you are from Comp Sci, Elecx, Civil, 
the questions will pertain to subject matter, mostly high level stuff.

2. Job switch (0-2 years of experience)
 * Data Structure and algorithms
  * Array , List, Stack, Queues, Trees (no Red Black, self balancing BSTs), and maybe basics of Graph like DFS, BFS
  * Work related questions

3. Job switch (2-4 years of experience)
  * DS Algo continued
  * Design Patterns (Head First)

4 Job Switch (4-7 years of experience)
  * Additional to above
   * High level design (Systen design)
   * Low level desig (object/class diagram)
   * Behavioral questions (major role now)


How does a typical 1 hour round look like 
(These days rounds are getting even shorter at 45 mins)
* Introduction by interviewer (big companies do this, startups avoid) - 5 mins
* Introduction by yourself - mentioned total work experience, your latest role, and 1-2 major contribution in that role. Remember this is not the round with hiring manager, and he will go through your resume in detials when time comes.
* Problem solving 
   * Whether it is a DS Also quesion or a system problem, the question will always be vague
   * Ask interviewer, shorten and simplify the problem. 
   * for this simple version, solve it stating assumptions and nuances (thread safety, exception handling)
   * Cover edge cases (bad input, known exception handling in code)

* Ask question to interviwer:
  * Ask him what the questions you have in mind

Gayle Lakmaan's booking on Cracking the Coding interview is undoubtedly the best book on this till date,
although in India the question levels might be different.
